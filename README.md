# GroundStation

GroundStation is the software project created by [Swifturk Team](http://www.swifturk.com/) 
to connect to, receive data from and send commands to a modular model satellite also developed by the same team. The project was created to participate in [TÃ¼rkSat Model Sattelite Competition](https://teknofest.org/yarisma-detaylar-16.html)

## Installation

The project needs .Net Framework 4.0, as well as the XNA Framework 4.0 to function. 
Use the instructions in the `Development Instructions.txt` or `Runtime Instructions.txt` depending on your intent.

## Usage

Ground Station connects to the model satellite via a custom application IP/UDP. I don't think that this project has any other usage other than for the Swifturk Sattelite. But I guess it can be a good resource and an example for future events and projects.
